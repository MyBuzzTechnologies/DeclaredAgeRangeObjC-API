## DeclaredAgeRange API Wrapper for Objective C
This project includes an Objective C framework and a test app that uses it to show how to use the Swift-Only library in apps that can only support Objective C.

For native Objective C apps written with XCode, this approach is unnecessary as you can write bridging files to achieve this more cleanly.

However, if you're using a cross platform dev system that doesn't support Swift directly (e.g. Delphi) then this approach works well.

If you want to see how this was created and wrapped, a full set of instructions are available here:
